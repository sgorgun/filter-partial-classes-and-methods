## Task description ##

- Analyze your solutions `Filter by Digit` and `Filter by Palindromic` tasks in terms of code common to them. What part of the code can be made reusable, and which part is customizable, depending on the specific way of matching the number with a certain attribute (predicate)?    
- Using the capabilities of `only static classes and methods (extension methods recommended)`, propose the option of allocating reusable code. Do not use LINQ, delegates or interfaces.
- Demonstrate the possibility of using common code with two different predicate of the number. Place solutions in two separate projects:
    - [Filter by digit](FilerByDigit/);
    - [Filter by palindromic](FilterByPalindromic/).
