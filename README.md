## Task description ##

> Analyze solutions `Filter by digit task` (Filter elements. Task #25) and `Filter by palindromic task` (Filter by Palindromic. Task #31) in terms of code common to them. What part of the code can be made reusable, and which part is customizable, depending on the specific way of matching the number with a certain attribute (predicate)?    
 - Using the capabilities of only static classes and methods (extension methods recommended), propose the option of allocating reusable code. **Do not use LINQ and delegates**.
 - Demonstrate the possibility of using common code with two different predicate of the number. Place solutions in two separate projects:
    - [Filter by digit](FilerByDigit/);
    - [Filter by palindromic](FilterByPalindromic/).
